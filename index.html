<h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2>
<p>Generations ago, the Empire deserted our island nation, leaving us stranded here with no way to reach the continent.
  They took all their riches with them, and our way of life fell into chaos. The young magi they had trained from our own people
  were able to hold society together and prevent famine and war.

<p>They did leave something behind for us, their great factories. But the Empire had not trained our magi in all their ways,
  and the once wonderful factories, that supplied our ancestors with lives of luxury, now just decorate the landscape.

<p>Of course, you know this already young scholar. With your days of being tutored behind you, it is now time to take your final
  test. You must venture forth and enter into one of the great factories. The factories are dangerous places, which work in ways
  we do not yet know and hide a great many secrets. But if you are to return with one of these secrets, just like every other scholar
  before you, we can hope to become masters of our own destiny.

<p>Good luck.
