<h1 align="center">Working Title: Mage Cage. </h1>
<h2 align="center"> Introduction </h2>
<p>A hundred years ago the Empire hastily left the island nation of Fendleigh, abandoning the machines and engines of their
  advanced technology. Without the resources of the Empire, life in Fendleigh all but fell apart, held together only by the remaining
  members of the Arcane University.

  With peace and prosperity in the land once again in sight, the scholars of the university turn their attention to exploring the
  wonders left behind, hoping to unravel the mysteries within.

<h2 align="center"> Controls </h2>

<p>Walk with 'a' and 'd'. Moving while in the air is also possible.
<p>Jump with 'w'. Jumping in mid-air costs mana, which regenerates over time.

<p> To cast spells, click and hold the left mouse button to charge up and aim the spell. Release the button to cast.
<p>Press 'e' to switch spells. The teleport spell propels you through the air with great speed, the barrier spell allows you to
  draw a small line in the air that acts as a platform.
